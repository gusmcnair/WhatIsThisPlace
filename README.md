<h3>What It Does</h3>
What Is This Place is a simple app that's designed to get information about the place you're visiting or driving through. Just search by GPS or by the location's name, and it will return information about the location's name, population, demographic characteristics, and popular local venues. It's built for road trips or other long drives, when one might pass through a locale and wonder what it's like there.

<h3>Summary</h3>
Upon opening the app, it displays a screen where the user can search via GPS (first attempting Google geolocation, then as a backup browser geolocation) or text. Upon clicking, the app converts this information to latitude and longitude values, then uses these to fetch information from the US Census and Foursquare, and displays these onscreen. The user then has the option to search again.
